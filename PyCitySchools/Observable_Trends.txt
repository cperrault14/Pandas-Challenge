Based on the results of the School District dataset, I can conclude the following:

1) It looks like the top 5 performing schools are all charter types of school whereas the bottom 5 
   performing schools all district types school.
   The top 5 charter schools seem to have less students per school when compared to the 5 
   bottom performing schools which may be the reason why they tend to perform well. 
   As an unsupported guess, less students might mean that each student gets the attention he/she needs 
   to succeed on a particular subject. In the bootom perfomaing school, it looks like students 
   tend to be worse in Math than Reading.



2) Money spent on average per student is not necessarily a factor when it comes to how well students 
   perform in school. The "Scores by School Spending" table demonstrates that when $585 or less is spent on 
   students, the average math, average reading, %passing math, % passing reading, % overall passing scores 
   seem to be higher than the other two ranges. Students seem to be doing worse in the $645-$680 spending range
   category. 
   The % Passing Math score seems to be very low in larger schools based on the "Scores by School Size" table. 
   The % Overall Passing score seems to be extremely low (roughly 58 %) in larger schools.
