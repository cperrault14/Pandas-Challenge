# Pandas-Challenge
2021 Data Analytics Bootcamp


    Here are some concepts that were covered in this Pandas Project:

      a. Calling out depencies such as Pandas library to access its functions
      
      
      b. Assigning variables in Jupyter Notebook


      c. Accessing functions in Pandas to calculate average, sum, perform counts of values


      d. Using Left Join to join two tables together on shared column to combine both datasets


      e. Creating new dataframe to hold summarized values


      f. Creating folders and files to use in directory

    As a Chief Data Scientist for my city's school district, I have been asked to analyze the district-wide standardized test results. I         am given access to every students' math and reading scores, as well as various information on the schools they attend. My                     responsibility is to aggregate the data to and showcase obvious trends in school performance.

    Based on my knowledge of Python, Jupyter Notebook and the Pandas library, my analysis led to the production of the following: 
  
        a. A district summary table with a high level snapshot of the total for all the schools in the district

        b. A school summary table with a high level snapshot of information per school
        
        c. 5 Top performing schools table
        
        d. 5 Bottom performing schools table
        
        e. Math Scores by grade table
        
        f. Reading Scores by grade table
        
        g. Scores by school spending
        
        h. Scores by school size
        
        i. Scores by school type
